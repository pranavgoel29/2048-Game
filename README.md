# 2048-Game

## Functions, components of the Game

- Initialize grid/matrix
- Swipes
  - Left
  - Right
  - Up
  - Down
- Check if ‚Üí Game Over or Complete
  - Basically when no more moves are left (Not able to add numbers), e.g. ‚Üí 2,4,8,2
- Reset if over

<br>
At First there will be two randomly placed 2s or 4s to start the game (Initial State)

    For Desktop we are using the arrow keys. ‚Üí, ‚Üê, ‚Üë, ‚Üì

## üì¶About Project

Tech Stack:

- React
- TypeScript
- Styled-Components (Add types, when using TS)
- Vite

Used 'lodash.clonedeep' for deep cloning the matrix.

<br>

### To change the Grid size and ending state, update the following in [Board.tsx](./src//Components/Board.tsx)

```javascript
gridSize //Changes size of the grid
winningNumber  // Winning state/number of the Game
```

<br>

I am documenting how I progressed with the whole game development, attaching screenshots for reference.
